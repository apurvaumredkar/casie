# Monica - AI Bot Suite on Cloudflare Workers

A production-ready Discord bot platform demonstrating modern serverless architecture on Cloudflare's edge network. This project showcases how to build scalable, globally distributed Discord bots without traditional server infrastructure.

---

## üéØ Overview

Monica is a **dual-bot platform** that demonstrates best practices for building Discord bots using serverless technology. Instead of running on traditional servers, these bots run on Cloudflare Workers - a serverless platform that executes code at 300+ edge locations worldwide.

**What makes this project unique:**
- Zero server management - deploy and forget
- Global edge deployment - sub-50ms response times worldwide
- Free tier covers most use cases - cost-effective scaling
- Production-ready patterns - OAuth, persistence, security
- Educational focus - clean code and clear architecture

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Why Cloudflare Workers?

Traditional Discord bots require always-on servers, complex infrastructure, and constant maintenance. Cloudflare Workers offers a fundamentally different approach:

**Traditional Approach:**
- Rent a VPS or use AWS EC2
- Maintain WebSocket connections 24/7
- Handle scaling, uptime, and deployments
- Pay for idle server time
- Single geographic location

**Workers Approach:**
- Serverless - no infrastructure to manage
- HTTP-based interactions (no persistent connections)
- Auto-scaling built-in
- Pay only for actual requests
- Deployed globally at 300+ locations

### How It Works

**Discord Interaction Flow:**
1. User types a command (e.g., `/play jazz`)
2. Discord sends an HTTP POST request to your Worker
3. Worker verifies the request signature (security)
4. Worker responds immediately ("processing...")
5. Worker processes the command in the background
6. Worker sends the final response back to Discord
7. User sees the result

**Key Components:**

**Edge Computing:**
- Code runs at the nearest Cloudflare data center
- Sub-50ms latency worldwide
- No cold starts (unlike AWS Lambda)
- Automatic failover and redundancy

**Persistent Storage:**
- Cloudflare KV for user tokens and preferences
- Eventually consistent key-value store
- Globally distributed
- Free tier: 100k reads/day, 1k writes/day

**Stateless OAuth:**
- Cryptographically signed state parameters
- No session storage required
- Survives Worker restarts
- CSRF protection included

**Security:**
- Ed25519 signature verification on all requests
- Encrypted secret storage
- Per-user rate limiting
- Input validation and sanitization
