   https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1433104809459974196&scope=bot%20applications.commands&permissions=2048

   Open in browser ‚Üí Select server ‚Üí Authorize


3. VERIFY SPOTIFY REDIRECT URI

   Go to: https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard
   Open your Spotify app settings
   Verify "Redirect URIs" includes:

   https://monica-spotify.apoorv-umredkar.workers.dev/oauth/callback

TESTING CHECKLIST

Once steps 1-3 are complete, test in Discord:

‚ñ° Type "/" in Discord - SpotiBot commands should appear
‚ñ° Run /linkspotify - Should provide authorization URL
‚ñ° Click link, authorize Spotify - Should redirect to success page
‚ñ° Run /nowplaying - Should confirm account is linked
‚ñ° Open Spotify on any device, start playing
‚ñ° Run /pause - Playback should pause
‚ñ° Run /play - Playback should resume
‚ñ° Run /next - Should skip track
‚ñ° Run /spotify query:play some jazz - AI should search and respond

TROUBLESHOOTING

- Check worker is deployed: curl https://monica-spotify.apoorv-umredkar.workers.dev/health
