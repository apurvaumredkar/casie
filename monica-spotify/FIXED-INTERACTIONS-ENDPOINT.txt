‚úÖ DISCORD INTERACTIONS ENDPOINT ISSUE FIXED
============================================

PROBLEM
-------
Discord was rejecting the interactions endpoint with error:
"The specified interactions endpoint url could not be verified."

ROOT CAUSE
----------
SpotiBot was using Monica Core's DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY instead of its own.
Discord sends a signed PING request to verify the endpoint, and signature
verification was failing because we had the wrong public key.

SOLUTION APPLIED
----------------
‚úÖ Created separate .env file for SpotiBot (isolated from Monica Core)
‚úÖ Updated DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY secret to SpotiBot's actual public key
‚úÖ Worker is healthy and responding correctly

SPOTIBOT CONFIGURATION
----------------------
Discord Public Key: 3092e0d6786cd16c93fce47ce6aaf694f49ba71d165f194c5088ec2c711bd11f
Application ID: 1433104809459974196
Worker URL: https://monica-spotify.apoorv-umredkar.workers.dev
Health Check: ‚úÖ Working

SECRETS NOW CONFIGURED (6 total)
---------------------------------
‚úÖ DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY (SpotiBot specific - NOW CORRECT)
‚úÖ OPENROUTER_API_KEY
‚úÖ BRAVE_API_KEY
‚úÖ SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID
‚úÖ SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET
‚úÖ SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI

ISOLATION IMPLEMENTED
---------------------
‚úÖ SpotiBot has its own .env file: spotify-worker/.env
‚úÖ Monica Core has its own .env file: .env
‚úÖ Each worker has separate secrets in Cloudflare
‚úÖ Complete isolation between the two bots

TRY AGAIN NOW
-------------
1. Go to: https://discord.com/developers/applications/1433104809459974196
2. Navigate to: General Information
3. Set Interactions Endpoint URL to:

   https://monica-spotify.apoorv-umredkar.workers.dev/interactions

4. Click "Save Changes"

‚úÖ This should now work! Discord will verify the endpoint successfully.

WHAT DISCORD DOES DURING VERIFICATION
--------------------------------------
1. Discord sends a POST request to /interactions
2. Request includes a signature signed with SpotiBot's PUBLIC KEY
3. Worker verifies signature using DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY secret
4. Worker responds with {"type": 1} (PONG)
5. If signature matches, Discord shows green checkmark ‚úÖ

VERIFICATION SCRIPT (for debugging if needed)
----------------------------------------------
If it still fails, check worker logs:
npx wrangler tail

You should see Discord's PING request come through.

NEXT STEPS AFTER VERIFICATION SUCCEEDS
---------------------------------------
1. ‚úÖ Set interactions endpoint (should work now)
2. Invite bot to server:
   https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1433104809459974196&scope=bot%20applications.commands&permissions=2048
3. Test commands in Discord
4. Enjoy SpotiBot! üéâ

CURRENT STATUS
--------------
‚úÖ Worker deployed
‚úÖ Secrets configured correctly
‚úÖ Commands registered
‚úÖ Public key FIXED
‚è≥ Awaiting Discord endpoint verification (should work now)
